Define main module:
Variable iFile to open given txt document "JubledMsg.txt" as a read file.
Variable oFile to open new txt document "MsgCGB.txt" as a write file.
Create variable "msg" to read lines* from iFile as a string.

Create for loop to remove unwanted numbers from msg.
Create if statement inside of for loop to find if 0 and 1 are in msg.
Create msg equal to the replacement of the unwanted numbers with "" (nothing-ness).

Create oFile to write msg variable into the created file.
Close oFile so no more writing can occur.

run main.

*TROUBLESHOOTING:
When I ran, 0's and 1's were gone, but newlines (\n) were being printed out instead of executed into the text file.
Had to change "readlines()" to "read()" in the variable msg so it would read the file correctly.
